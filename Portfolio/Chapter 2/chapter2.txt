To create a "Hello, World!" app in Flutter, start by creating a new Flutter project using the command flutter create hello_world in your terminal. Navigate into the project directory with cd hello_world. Open the project in your preferred code editor, such as Visual Studio Code or Android Studio. In the lib directory, locate the main.dart file. Replace the contents of main.dart with a simple Flutter app: use the MaterialApp widget as the root, and define its home property with a Scaffold widget. Inside the Scaffold, set the body to a Center widget containing a Text widget with the string "Hello, World!". Save the file, then run the app using flutter run in your terminal, or launch it from your editor. The app will display "Hello, World!" centered on the screen.
