To install and set up Flutter, first, download the Flutter SDK from flutter.dev and extract it to a desired location. Add the Flutter bin directory to your system's PATH to enable global access to Flutter commands. Next, install a code editor, such as Visual Studio Code or Android Studio, and integrate the Flutter plugin for code assistance and debugging. Ensure you have the required dependencies: install the Android SDK, set up Android Studio for Android development, and, if on macOS, install Xcode for iOS development. Run flutter doctor in your terminal to check for any missing dependencies and follow its recommendations to resolve them. Once set up, you can create a new Flutter project using flutter create <project_name>, then navigate to the project directory and use flutter run to launch your app on a connected device or emulator.
